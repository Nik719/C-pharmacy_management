Pharmacy management (MDS)

Experiment 1. Sequential programming
Write a program to store the following details - Customer ID, Age,Customer type ( Regular - R and Temporary - T),
Medicine Id, quantity of medicine to be purchased. Declare variables of appropriate data types, read the values from
the user and calculate the final bill based on the quantity of purchase made, add GST of 5% to the total amount.
Display the customer bill with all the necessary information.

Experiment 2a Decision making using else if ladder
Write the program to generate the customer bill based on the following 1. Discount of 10% for regular customers.
2. Based on the Medicine name (P - paracetamol Rs 5/tab, L - Levocitrizine Rs2/tab R - Rantac Rs2/tab 
A - Amoxicillin Rs 10/tab) fix the rate of the tablet accordingly (Read the medicine name from the user 
and store it in a variable). (extend the previous program to implement the above) Display the customer medical bill 
with all the necessary information.

Experiment 2b Decision making using switch case
write a program to display menu 1. Customer details 2. Customer bill 3. Exit, Based on the input selection by the
user appropriate actions needs to taken care. Use previous program and extend it.


Experiment 3 Looping
Write a program to include an Exit Option by the user. The menu should be displayed, only if the user selects the option
4. Exit should the loop run. Use do while to implement the same. Extend the previous program to implement the program.

Exeriment 4 (Nested for loop)
Write a program in C to display the following patern
+

+ + +
+ + + +
+ + + + +

Experiment 5 1D Arrays
Write a program to implement arrays to store multiple patient details. Implement a logic to search for a patients details
using binary search.

Experiment 6 2D Arrays
Write a program to add two matrices

Experiment 7 Pointers
Write a program to read n number of patient_ids and total bill paid (for in and out patients) into an array.
Calculate the total amount spent a particular Patient and display the same in the form of Patient Account balance sheet.
Implement the same using pointers.

Experiment 8 User defined functions
write a program to implement user defined functions to implement the following functionality 1. Patient details 
2. Receipt Bill Generation 3. Patient Data collection

Experiment 9 Structures
Write a progam to create a structure for storing the patient details. Use appropriate data types to store the data 
(arrays, strings etc). Extend the previous program to implement the same.

Experiment 10 Files
Write a program to store the patient data into a file and extract data based on the users requirement
